# Ukrainian Borscht

## Ingredients

- Meet
- Veggies
- Oil
- Herbs
- Spices
- Toppings
- Sour cream or yogurt


## Instructions

- Cube meat into 1-2" pieces. Add to a large soup pot or Dutch oven along with soup bones and bay leaves. Cover with 10 cups of cold water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, cover and simmer on low heat for 45 minutes to an hour.
- While the meat is cooking, prepare your vegetables by dicing the onion, and chopping the carrots and celery. Next, slice (or shred) the cabbage, peel and cube the potatoes, and peel and julienne the beets.
- Add onions, carrots, celery, and chopped bacon to the pot. Sauté for a few minutes then season with salt and pepper. Add tomato paste and sauté for a few more minutes.
- Pour strained broth back into the pot. Mix to dissolve the tomato paste. Add potatoes, beets, and cabbage, then cover and simmer over low heat, for 30 minutes or until the potatoes are fork tender.
- Add vinegar (or beet sour), chopped parsley, dill, and minced garlic. Mix to combine the soup ingredients. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes then taste to see if the seasoning needs to be adjusted. I added a teaspoon of sugar and ½ teaspoon of citric acid.
- Ukrainian borscht is usually topped with a dollop of sour cream or yogurt and garnished with additional fresh dill. You can also use Italian parsley to garnish the finished dish.
