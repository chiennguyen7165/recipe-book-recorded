# Vietnamese Lemongrass Grilled Pork

## Ingredients

- 1.5 to 2 lbs of a fatty cut of pork, like shoulder or belly. I like to use belly
- 2 Tps fish sauce
- 1 Tps oyster sauce
- 3 Tps sugar or honey
- 3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1-2 shallots, minced
- ½ cup minced lemongrass
- salt
- pepper
- bamboo or metal skewers (optional)

## Instructions

- Step 1: Trim off large chunks of fat or gristle from the pork. If you're using pork belly with skin, remove the skin as well.
- Step 2: Slice the pork into thin strips, about ¼ inch (0.5 cm) thick.
- Step 3: In a mixing bowl, add fish sauce, oyster sauce, sugar or honey, minced garlic, minced shallots, finely chopped lemongrass, salt, and pepper.
- Step 4: Add the sliced pork to the bowl and mix thoroughly to coat the meat evenly with the marinade.
- Step 5: Let the pork marinate for at least 30 minutes. For the best flavour, marinate it overnight in the refrigerator.
- Step 6: If you prefer grilling with skewers, thread the pork onto skewers by folding each strip and piercing it through the skewer twice. Leave a few inches of space on both ends of the skewer for easy handling.
- Step 7: Grill the pork skewers over propane, charcoal, or an indoor tabletop grill. Flip them regularly until they are evenly charred and cooked through.
- Step 8: As an alternative, bake the pork at 375°F (190°C) in the oven. Flip the meat every 5 minutes and broil it for 1–2 minutes at the end to achieve a nice char. The total cooking time should be around 15–20 minutes.
- Step 9: Serve the grilled pork hot with rice, vermicelli noodles, fresh vegetables, and a dipping sauce of your choice.
